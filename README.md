# Proof of concept: Meteor, S3 & Imgix

From a meteor app, upload an image to S3, download device specific derived image from imgix.

To run it: `$ meteor --settings settings.json`, where `settings.json` follows
`settings.template.json`.  Just replace with your credentials.

More details in `upload-images.js` comments.

Please, feel free to share any improvements.
